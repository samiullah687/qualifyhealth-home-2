                    <p>
                      ARBITRATION AGREEMENT Any dispute or claim relating in any way
                      to your use of this website, including any related calls texts
                      or other communications, will be resolved by binding
                      arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert
                      claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. This
                      includes claims against our clients, vendors, and Marketing
                      Partners, which are third party beneficiaries of this
                      arbitration agreement. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal
                      arbitration law apply to this agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
                      arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award
                      on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
                      (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory
                      damages), and must follow the terms of these terms as a court
                      would.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The arbitration may be conducted by the American Arbitration
                      Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's
                      Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The
                      AAA's rules are available at
                      <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling
                      1-800-778-7879. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted
                      by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the
                      county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
                      conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
                      consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim
                      proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any
                      right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may
                      bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
                      intellectual property rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      MODIFICATIONS. Company may, in its sole discretion and without
